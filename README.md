# BotBrowser

There wasn't a browser on the market that did what I wanted, so I wrote my own.

For bot - I don't recommend writing direct solver code for antibots. Because the antibot system is updated very quickly, the algorithms change frequently, and they have a lot of developers, you can get bogged down by them.

So, it's best to find the fingerprints collected by the antibot, modify Chromium to make a generic fingerprint browser, and then use CDP (playwright / puppeteer) to control this browser to implement the corresponding logic.
